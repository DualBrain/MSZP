In QB64 go in "Run" menu and check "Output EXE to source folder".
Put the set.ico inside QB64 install folder or it will give an error.
The rest can stay in MSZP folder.

MSZP.bas is the main program

All folders are created by the software itself if missing (inside the same folder it is located),
so the EXE is the only thing necesarry once compiled.
I'll just include the Data folder to have some examples saved.
